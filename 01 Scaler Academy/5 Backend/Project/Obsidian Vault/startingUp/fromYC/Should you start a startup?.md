- ***Resilient*** people are suited to startups and should definitely become founders but
	1. How to know if you have the enough resilience to be a startup founder?
		- *Confidence* is not the right metric because someone who appears confident in the beginning might not be resilient when startup hit roadblocks. Conversely some of the quietest and least confident seeming founders at first have turned out to be the most resilient founders.
		- *Right motivation* also does not matter as much. It's become popular that you should not start a company to make money because that's considered as somewhat flimsy motivation.but it's perfectly fine to start a startup to become rich because it provides ways to make life changing amount of money in relatively short periods of time.
		- *Curiosity* is also enough reason to start a startup. simple being curious about the experience of starting a startup is enough to get going.

	 Actually doing a startup is the only way to know if you will really enjoy it or not. The reason initial motivation does not matter because motivation changes overtime. In order to keep going through those dark times you need enduring motivations and the best ones are genuinely interested in the problem that you are solving and love the people you are working with.   

- If you are curious about starting a company ask yourself the following
	- ***what do I have to loose ?***
		- figure out what are the worst case scenario of starting a startup and decide if you can live with that? it will take you around at least a year to collect the data to tell if the startup you are working on is promising enough to keep working on. if you are a FAANGM employee then you have lot more to lose than one who just works for a startup.
		- If you cannot handle the worst case then your own *constant anxiety will probably-sabotage* your startup efforts.
	- ***Learning*** 
		- you will learn a lot by starting a company as a founder you are responsible for almost everything so you get to do lot's of different work, you will have to do some amount of sales , product and customer support and this can really help you clarify what kind of stuff you really like and even if the startup fails where you want to go. 

- ***Career Growth***
	- You will learn the skill of being a self starter and being able to take initiative and   lead projects.
	- Many companies including YC hires former founders to run a specific product lines and really run them as a general managers 

- ***How to prepare to start a company in the future?***
	- If you really want to start a company one day then you want yourself to be in an environment where  you will be around many people who might someday be your cofounder and the best place for this is *working in a startup* because colleagues would be less risk averse than average FAANGM employees. so if you are in FAANGM currently it would be better to leave and join small startup as an intermediate step. [Not for us I guess] 
	- Once you are around smart people  who enjoy talking about ideas with i'd recommend you start experimenting with turning these ideas into small side projects and some point in your conversation you will say it would be cool *if someone built X* and that is the moment to stop and think about how you could be the one to built X. 
		- Is there a simple first version that you could build over a weekend or can you find other people who might be users and pitch them the idea to be see how they react. keep pulling on the threads until you have come up with a plan to turn this idea into something real however small it is.*REMEMBER right now you are not trying to launch next UNICORN*. you are just getting used to the experience of turning an ideas into reality and experience the thrill of launching something. To turn your idea into something real you will need the skills to actually build them.
 ***when to quit Job ?***
	- Even if you launch a product and get some users , the feedback would be mixed.To judge how promising your side project is as a startup idea.
		- *It is better to make a product that few people really love than one a lot of people are indifferent towards.*
		- *A single passionate user of crude prototype that was hacked together in a weekend means so much more than a million sign-ups on a waitlist for a something that does not exist yet.*

***ADVICE***
	- *Think less about how well your side projects are going and think more about how much are you enjoying the process of thinking up the ideas and turning them into something real. If you find your job draining and you have the energy to work on side projects on evening and weekends that's the sign to quit and work on your own ideas. Pay particular attention on how much you enjoy working with your side project collaborators* . ***If you enjoy working with them and you both want to be startup founders recognise how rare that is having a great co-founder who wants to do a startup is fantastic reason to quit and start one***
