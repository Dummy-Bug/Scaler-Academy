### Problem Description

Given an directed acyclic graph having A nodes. A matrix B of size M x 2 is given which represents the M edges such that there is a edge directed from node B[i][0] to node B[i][1].

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

Return the topological ordering of the graph and if it doesn't exist then return an empty array.

If there is a solution return the correct ordering. If there are multiple solutions print the lexographically smallest one.

Ordering (a, b, c) is said to be lexographically smaller than ordering (e, f, g) if a < e or if(a==e) then b < f and so on.

NOTE:

There are no self-loops in the graph.
There are no multiple edges between two nodes.
The graph may or may not be connected.
Nodes are numbered from 1 to A.
Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.


Problem Constraints
2 <= A <= 104

1 <= M <= min(100000,A*(A-1))

1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A



Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A representing the number of nodes in the graph.

The second argument given a matrix B of size M x 2 which represents the M edges such that there is a edge directed from node B[i][0] to node B[i][1].



Output Format
Return a one-dimensional array denoting the topological ordering of the graph and it it doesn't exist then return empty array.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 6
 B = [  [6, 3] 
        [6, 1] 
        [5, 1] 
        [5, 2] 
        [3, 4] 
        [4, 2] ]
Input 2:

 A = 3
 B = [  [1, 2]
        [2, 3] 
        [3, 1] ]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [5, 6, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Output 2:

 []


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The given graph contain no cycle so topological ordering exists which is [5, 6, 1, 3, 4, 2]
Explanation 2:

 The given graph contain cycle so topological ordering not possible we will return empty array.
 
 
 **Solution Approach**
 
 
 A DAG G has at least one vertex with in-degree 0 and one vertex with out-degree 0.
Proof: Thereâ€™s a simple proof to the above fact is that a DAG does not contain a cycle which means that all paths will be of finite length.
Now let S be the longest path from u(source) to v(destination). Since S is the longest path there can be no incoming edge to u and no outgoing edge from v, if this situation had occurred then S would not have been the longest path
=> indegree(u) = 0 and outdegree(v) = 0

Algorithm:
Steps involved in finding the topological ordering of a DAG:

Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.

Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a min priority queue (Enqueue operation)

Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.

Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
Step 5: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.

Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.

How to find in-degree of each node?
There are 2 ways to calculate in-degree of every vertex:
Take an in-degree array which will keep track of
1) Traverse the array of edges and simply increase the counter of the destination node by 1.

for each node in Nodes
indegree[node] = 0;
for each edge(src,dest) in Edges
indegree[dest]++
Time Complexity: O(V+E)

2) Traverse the list for every node and then increment the in-degree of all the nodes connected to it by 1.

for each node in Nodes
    If (list[node].size()!=0) then
    for each dest in list
        indegree[dest]++;
We are using priority queue as we have to output the lexographically smallest ordering.

Overall time complexity: O((VlogV+E)
