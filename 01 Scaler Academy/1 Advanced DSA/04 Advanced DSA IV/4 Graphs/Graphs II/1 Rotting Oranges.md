**SOlution Approach**

  Every turn, the rotting spreads from each rotting orange to other adjacent oranges.
  Initially, the rotten oranges have â€˜depthâ€™ 0, and every time they rot a neighbor,
  the neighbors have 1 more depth. We want to know the largest possible depth.

  Use multi-source BFS to achieve this with all cells containing rotten oranges as starting nodes.
  At the end check if there are fresh oranges left or not.
