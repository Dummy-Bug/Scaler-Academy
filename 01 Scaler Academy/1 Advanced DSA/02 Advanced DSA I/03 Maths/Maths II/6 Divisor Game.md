### Problem Description

Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.

Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell the number of special integers 
less than or equal to A.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B, C <= 109



Input Format
First argument is a positive integer A
Second argument is a positive integer B
Third argument is a positive integer C



Output Format
One integer corresponding to the number of special integers less than or equal to A.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 12
 B = 3
 C = 2
Input 2:

 A = 6
 B = 1
 C = 4


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.
Explanation 2:

 Only 4 is a positive integer less than equal to 6 which is divisible by 1 and 4.
 
 **Solution Approach**
 
We canâ€™t loop, so we can try for another approach, i.e., find the lcm(least common multiple) of B and C and find the number of
elements less than equal to A, which is divisible by lcm.
lcm(A,B)=(A*B)/(gcd(A,B))
 
 ```
 
 class Solution:

    def solve(self, A, B, C):

        lcm = None;

        gcd = self.gcd(B,C);

        lcm = ((B*C))//(gcd);

        return A//lcm;
        
        return result;
        
    def gcd(self, A, B):

        if B == 0:
            return A;
        
        return self.gcd(B,A%B);
        
# Time Complexity: O(log(min(a,b))

# Auxiliary Space: O(log(min(a,b))
 
 ```
