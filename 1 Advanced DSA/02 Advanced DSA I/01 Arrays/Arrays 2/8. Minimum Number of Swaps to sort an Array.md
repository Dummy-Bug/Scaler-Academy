### Minimum Number of Swaps to sort an Array containing integers rangning from [0,n-1]

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-swaps/1


**Notes**

> Suppose we have array A=[A0, A1, A2… ]

Now, let’s keep iterating over this array, and if Ai != i, We swap it with index Ai (that’s where Ai belongs). If you work it out, you can always see some cycle will form.

Example:

[4, 0, 1, 3, 2]
swap_index(0,4) -> swap_index(0,2) -> swap_index(0,1) (3 swaps)
[2, 0, 1, 4, 3]
swap_index(0,2) -> swap_index(0,1) (2 swaps)
swap_index(3,4) (1 swaps)
Answers would be the sum of { individual length of cycle - 1}

Remember to use some flags to not visit the same elements again and again


```

class Solution:
    def solve(self, A):

        n = len(A);swaps = 0;

        for index in range(n):
            
            while index != A[index]:
                temp = A[index];
                A[index] = A[A[index]];
                A[temp] = temp;
                swaps += 1;

        return swaps

```
