### Problem Description

You have an array A with N elements. We have two types of operation available on this array :
We can split an element B into two elements, C and D, such that B = C + D.
We can merge two elements, P and Q, to one element, R, such that R = P ^ Q i.e., XOR of P and Q.
You have to determine whether it is possible to convert array A to size 1, containing a single element equal to 0 after several splits and/or merge?



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000

1 <= A[i] <= 106



Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A of size N.



Output Format
Return "Yes" if it is possible otherwise return "No".



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [9, 17]
Input 2:

 A = [1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 Yes
Output 2:

 No


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Following is one possible sequence of operations -  
 1) Merge i.e 9 XOR 17 = 24  
 2) Split 24 into two parts each of size 12  
 3) Merge i.e 12 XOR 12 = 0  
 As there is only 1 element i.e 0. So it is possible.
Explanation 2:

 There is no possible way to make it 0.
 
 **Solution Approach**
 
 If any element in the array is even then, it can be made 0. Split that element into two equal parts of A[i]/2 and A[i]/2. 
 XOR of two identical numbers is zero. Therefore this strategy makes an element 0.
 If any element is odd. Split it in two-part: 1, A[i]-1. Since A[i]-1 is even, it can be made 0 by the above strategy. 
 Therefore an odd element can reduce its size to 1.
 Therefore, two odd elements can be made 0 by following the above strategy and finally XOR them (i.e., 1) as 1 XOR 1 = 0.
 Therefore if the number of odd elements in the array is even, the answer is possible. Otherwise, an element of value 1 will be left, 
 and it is impossible to satisfy the condition.

        count = 0;

        for i in range(len(A)):
            if (A[i])&1 == 1:
                count += 1;
        
        return "Yes" if count%2 == 0 else "No";

        Sum = 0;

        for i in range(len(A)):
            Sum = Sum + A[i];
        
        if Sum%2 != 0:
            return 'No';
        else:
            return 'Yes';
