### Problem Description

You are given three positive integers, A, B, and C.

Any positive integer is magical if divisible by either B or C.

Return the Ath smallest magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return modulo 109 + 7.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109

2 <= B, C <= 40000



Input Format
The first argument given is an integer A.

The second argument given is an integer B.

The third argument given is an integer C.



Output Format
Return the Ath smallest magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return modulo 109 + 7.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 1
 B = 2
 C = 3
Input 2:

 A = 4
 B = 2
 C = 3


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 6


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 1st magical number is 2.
Explanation 2:

 First four magical numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6 so the 4th magical number is 6.

**Solution Approach**

Say L = lcm(B, C), the least common multiple of B and C, and let f(x) be the number of magical numbers less than or equal to x.
A well known result says that L = (B*C)/gcd(B,C), and that we can calculate the function gcd.

Then f(x) = x/B + x/C - x/L (floor of all the divisions)

Why? There are x/B numbers B, 2B, 3Bâ€¦. that are divisible by B, there are x/C numbers divisible by C, and we need to subtract the x/L numbers divisible by B and C that we double-counted.

Finally,the answer must be between 0 and A * min(B,C).

If x increases f(x) increases, we can use binary search on x to find the Ath number.

Algorithm: Not implemented in code but this is better wayyy...
1) Low=1 and High = A * min(B,C)
2) Find mid = (low + high)/2
3) Find f(mid) let it be count
4) If count>=A then mark it as a answer and try to find smaller number which implies high = mid-1
5) Else low = mid+1
6) Repeat steps 2 to 5 until low<=high

Time Complexity: O(log (A * min(B, C)))
Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : integer
    # @return an integer

    def gcd(self,A,B):
        if B == 0:
            return A 

        return self.gcd(B,A % B)


    def checkNth(self,mid,A,B):
        val = (mid//A) + (mid//B)
        LCM = (A * B //self.gcd(A,B))

        count = val - (mid //LCM)
        return count 

    def binarysearch(self,N,a,b):
        modval = 1000000007 
        low = min(a,b)

        high = N * ( min(a,b) )

        ans = 0

        while low <= high:
            
            mid = low + (high - low )// 2
            
            
            if self.checkNth(mid,a,b) >= N:
                if self.checkNth(mid,a,b) == N:
                    ans = mid % modval
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return ans 


    def solve(self, A, B, C):
        modval = 1000000007
        res = self.binarysearch(A,B,C) % modval

        return res
