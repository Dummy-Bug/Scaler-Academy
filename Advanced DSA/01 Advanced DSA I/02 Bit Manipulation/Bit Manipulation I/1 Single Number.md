### Problem Description

Given an array of integers A, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 2000000

0 <= A[i] <= INTMAX



Input Format
The first and only argument of input contains an integer array A.



Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the single element.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 2, 2]


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

3 occurs once.
Explanation 2:

1 occurs once.


```

class Solution:

    def singleNumber(self, A):

        xor = 0;

        for i in range(len(A)):

            xor = xor^A[i];
        
        return xor;

```
