### Problem Description

Given n non-negative integers A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-1] , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, A[i]).

N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, A[i]) and (i, 0).

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.



Problem Constraints
0 <= N <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 105



Input Format
Single Argument representing a 1-D array A.



Output Format
Return single Integer denoting the maximum area you can obtain.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [1, 5, 4, 3]
Input 2:

A = [1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 6
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 
5 and 3 are distance 2 apart. So size of the base = 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. 
So total area = 3 * 2 = 6
Explanation 2:

**Solution Approach**

Description of approach 1:

Note 1: When you consider a1 and aN, then the area is (N-1) * min(a1, aN).
Note 2: The base (N-1) is the maximum possible.
This implies that if there was a better solution possible, it will definitely have height greater than min(a1, aN).

B * H > (N-1) * min(a1, aN)
We know that, B < (N-1)
So, H > min(a1, aN)

This means that we can discard min(a1, aN) from our set and look to solve this problem again from the start.
If a1 < aN, then the problem reduces to solving the same thing for a2, aN.
Else, it reduces to solving the same thing for a1, aN-1

```

public class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] A) {

        int i = 0,j = A.length - 1;
        int max_water = 0;

        while (i<j){

            int left_container  = A[i];
            int right_container = A[j];

            int curr_water = Math.min(left_container,right_container)*(j-i);

            max_water = Math.max(max_water,curr_water);

            if (left_container < right_container)i++;
            else j--;

        }
        return max_water;
    }
}


```
