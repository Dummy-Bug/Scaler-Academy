### Problem Description

Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M in which each row is sorted.

Find and return the overall median of matrix A.

NOTE: No extra memory is allowed.

NOTE: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 10^5

1 <= N*M <= 10^6

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

N*M is odd



Input Format
The first and only argument given is the integer matrix A.



Output Format
Return the overall median of matrix A.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [   [1, 3, 5],
        [2, 6, 9],
        [3, 6, 9]   ] 
Input 2:

A = [   [5, 17, 100]    ]


Example Output
Output 1:

 5 
Output 2:

 17


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, 9, 9]
Median is 5. So, we return 5. 
Explanation 2:

Median is 17.

**Solution Approach**

-> We cannot use extra memory, so we canâ€™t store all elements in an array and sort the array.
  But since rows are sorted, it must be of some use, right?

  Note that in a row, you can binary search to find how many elements are smaller than a value X in O(log M).
  This is the base of our solution.

  Say k = N*M/2. We need to find (k + 1)^th smallest element.
  We can use binary search on the answer. In O(N log M), we can count how many elements are smaller than X in the matrix.

  So, we use binary search on the interval [1, INT_MAX]. So, the total complexity is O(30 * N log M).

 Note:
  This problem can be solved by using a min-heap, but extra memory is not allowed.

```

class Solution:

	def matrix_search(self,A,B):
		
		num_ele = 0;
		
		for row in range(len(A)):

			low  = 0; high = len(A[0])-1;
			index = -1;
			
			while low <= high:
				
				mid = (low+high)//2;
				
				if A[row][mid] < B:
					index = mid;
					low   = mid + 1;
				else:
					high = mid - 1;
			
			num_ele += (index+1);
		
		return num_ele;
				
		
	def findMedian(self, A):
		
		low = float('inf');
		for i in range(len(A)):
			low = min(low,A[i][0]);
		
		high = float('-inf');
		for i in range(len(A)):
			high = max(high,A[i][-1]);
			
		median = -1;
		n = (len(A)*len(A[0]))//2;
		
		while low <= high:
			
			mid = low + (high-low)//2;
			ans = self.matrix_search(A,mid);

			if ans <= n:
				median = mid;
				low = mid + 1
			if ans > n:
				high = mid - 1
		
		return median;
