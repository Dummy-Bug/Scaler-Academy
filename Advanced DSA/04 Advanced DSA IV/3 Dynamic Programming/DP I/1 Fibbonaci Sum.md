### Problem Definition

Given a positive integer A, write a program to find the Ath Fibonacci number.

In a Fibonacci series, each term is the sum of the previous two terms and the first two terms of the series are 0 and 1. i.e. f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Hence, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2, f(4) = 3 and so on.

NOTE: 0th term is 0. 1th term is 1 and so on.



Problem Constraints
0 <= A <= 44



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the Ath Fibonacci number.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 4
Input 2:

 A = 6


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 8


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Terms of Fibonacci series are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on.
 0th term is 0 So, 4th term of Fibonacci series is 3. 
Explanation 2:

 6th term of Fibonacci series is 8.
 
 
 A simple approach is to use the recursive implementation of the recursive relation given.

For ex: Calculate 4th term.

               fib(4)   
             /        \     
         fib(3)      fib(2)
        /    \       /    \     
  fib(2)   fib(1)  fib(1) fib(0)
  /     \
fib(1) fib(0)
We can see that the 2nd term is calculated multiple times.

If we try to find large Fibonacci numbers, there will be more and more repetitions that are bad.

Time complexity of above: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) is exponential.

To avoid this, try to store the term which is calculated once and before calculating any other term check if it is already calculated or not.

If we already have that term use that. This will save us a lot of repetitions.

In this we are only calculating each term once, So, time complexity will be linear.

Approach 2

We can easily generate the Fibonacci series iteratively in linear time.

Initialise: fib[0] = 0, fib[1] = 1

for i from 2 to A.
    fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2].
fib[A] will be our answer.

def main():
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    # Please take input and print output to standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
    # E.g. 'input()/raw_input()' for input & 'print' for output
    
    val = int( input() );
    temp_arr = [-1]*(val+1);
    temp_arr[0] = 0; temp_arr[1] = 1;

    for i in range(2,len(temp_arr)):
        temp_arr[i] = temp_arr[i-1] + temp_arr[i-2];
    
    print( temp_arr[val] );


    return 0

    main()

```

def main():
    
    val = int( input() );
    first,second = 1,0;

    for i in range(2,val+1):
        summ =  first+second;
        second = first;
        first  = summ;
        
    print(first);
        


    return 0
